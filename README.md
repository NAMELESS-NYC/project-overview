## Overview

Nameless is a loyalty & engagement platform for the experience economy. Our platform empowers brands and event organizers to connect physical and digital experiences through journeys to  
find, reward, and retain customers.

Nameless turns live event interactions into lasting digital connections. By using on-chain digital collectibles, we enable our clients to:

- **Capture Interactions**: Collect data through RSVPs, QR Code scans, & NFC Taps

- **Delight Attendees**: Engage attendees with gamified journeys, raffles, & digital memorobilia

- **Measure Success**: Track engagement, social impressions, and UGC

- **Build Loyalty** Reward interactions with access to communities, merchandise, & discounts

## Platform

Nameless is built on the Aptos and leverages its token standard for its digital collectibles. Enabled by the sub-second finality on Aptos, Nameless is able to achieve its goals of seamless user onboarding and instantaneous collectible minting at events. The nature of using technology at live events requires reliable, realtime transaction processing and Aptos provides the powerful backing needed to create a positive user experience and reliable data platform.

Our platform provides tooling to enable the use of digital collectibles in the experience economy. Our core functionalities include:

- **Distribution** Prove seamless onboarding and token distribution using wallets and claim links.

- **Creation** Empower brands to create and distribute their own tokens via an intuitive portal.

- **Customization** Tailor customizable, modular journeys based on client insights.

- **Integration** Integrate these journeys into key e-commerce, ticketing, & social media platforms.

Our product roadmap includes an API service to enable the use of Nameless core functionality in third party applications. Our contract code and token standard is designed to allow for open-source development of additional token utility, outside of Nameless applications, in the future.
